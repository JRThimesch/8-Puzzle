# Usage
Run the script through `py ./Puzzle.py`

When prompted, enter in the numbers for the corresponding coordinates for both the start and goal states.
As outlined in the homework, a 0 corresponds to an empty tile.
Once both puzzles have received their numbers, the script will attempt to solve the puzzle.

Alternatively, the puzzles can be hardcoded in the constructors as a list of lists.
